 *
 * Hashmap's and dictionary's are from a user point of view the
 * same thing, they are both a key-value store. They do however
 * differ in implementation. Dictionary's are optimized for speed,
 * as where hashmap's are optimized for memory usage. The overhead
 * for hashmaps is much lower. Hashmaps should be used for storing
 * small amounts of data, as where dictionary's shine in storing
 * large amounts of entry's.
