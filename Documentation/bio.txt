/**
 * @defgroup bio Background I/O API
 * @ingroup storage
 * @brief Module to manage I/O which can be handled in the background.
 *
 * This module is responsible for handling all the back ground I/O that
 * needs to be done. Most notably, it is reponsible for persistance. When
 * write operations (may it be an actual write, or a delete) are done on
 * the in-memory database, the BIO module will transparantly do these
 * same changes on the on-disk database.
